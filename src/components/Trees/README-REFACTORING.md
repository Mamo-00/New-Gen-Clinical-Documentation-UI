# DynamicTree Component Refactoring

This refactoring improves the original DynamicTree component while maintaining all functionality and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Refactoring Approach

The refactoring takes a balanced approach:

1. **Single-file solution**: Keeps all logic in one file but with better organization
2. **Utility functions**: Moves complex functions to the top of the file with clear categorization
3. **Focused sections**: Divides the component into clear, labeled sections (utility functions, state, callbacks, effects, render)
4. **Simplified logic**: Reduces unnecessary complexity in template processing
5. **Better comments**: Adds clear documentation for each function and section

## Key Improvements

1. **Improved readability**: Code sections are clearly labeled and organized
2. **Reduced redundancy**: Common logic patterns are extracted to utility functions
3. **Better state management**: Clearer handling of template and tree item state
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: All related functionality stays in one file but is better structured
5. **Optimized memory usage**: Strategic use of `useMemo` and `useCallback` for frequently used values and functions

## Usage

Replace references to the original DynamicTree with the new component:

```jsx
import DynamicTreeRefactored from './components/Trees/DynamicTreeRefactored';

// Use exactly like the original component
<DynamicTreeRefactored
  title="My Tree"
  schema={schema}
  editorId="editor1"
  itemLabel="section"
/>
```

This refactoring preserves all original functionality while improving code quality and maintainability, without introducing the complexity of multiple files and dependencies.
